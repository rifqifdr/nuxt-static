# Commands and Deployment

## Build Setup

Start the local `dev` server:

```sh
$ npm run dev # or yarn dev
```

## Static Deployment

Nuxt.js will create a `dist/` directory with everything inside ready to be deployed on a static hosting service.

Generate your static application:

```sh
$ npm run generate # or yarn generate
```

Once your application is built you can use the `start` command to see a production version of your application.

Serve the generated static application from a `dist/` directory:

```sh
$ npm run start # or yarn start
```

This is useful for final testing before deploying.
